	* [r870] Bug fix : close VideoFile now ends all the libav threads (in
	  codec processor).
	* [r869] Implementation of varying size picture queue : the number of
	  frames in the buffer between decoding thread and display loop is based
	  on the size of the file (e.g. 10% num frames total) and is adjusted
	  depending on the play speed (larger if playing faster to allow decoder
	  to read faster forward when speed is higher).

2014-04-30  bruno.herbelin@gmail.com

	* [r868] New implementation of VideoPicture and of the picture queue in
	  VideoFile: Dynamic allocation of the queue to ensure the picture
	  created is never erazed or changed before it is dispayed. This fix the
	  long lasing bug with pictq and the read-write indices: the VideoSource
	  was displaing the frame AFTER (asynchronously) the pictq read index
	  was set, i.e sometimes too late and then jumping randomly in the
	  queue.

	  display of time functions
	* [r858] IMPORTANT REIMPLEMENTATION of VideoFile - Management of time
	  with a Clock object, all in video time base (double) - management of
	  parsing states to avoid seeking problems - communication between
	  threads using actions information within the packets or the frames
	  THIS WAY : - actions (seek or stop) happen on the frame (not delayed
	  by queue size) - seeking is not causing problem between frames -
	  displayed time is exact

	* [r189] Yet again BUG FIX ; error in stop introduced by some recent
	  changes, cleaning of code (drop option to use a thread for video
	  refresh ; the idea is bad as it uses signal/slots to inform video
	  source to update frame, which is not very robust between threads)
	* [r188] Clean up in management of option
	  RenderingManager::blit_fbo_extension
	* [r187] bug fix on my former bug fix...

2010-07-28  bruno.herbelin

	* [r184] More BUG FIX in Video FIle : this time, I think its much better
	  : 1) I do nothing special in the refresh timer (so there is no jump/
	  jerk of picture) BUT, 2) when the refresh timer start to be late on
	  presentation time, it tells the Decoding thread to skip the next
	  frame. This way, 1 or 2 frames later, the presentation time stamp to
	  show is 1 frame later, so we can catch up. (+ compilation complain
	  fixed in Rendering Manager XML).

2010-07-27  bruno.herbelin

	* [r182] bug fix again.... (culling in source and looping in video file)
	* [r181] AAAARG ! Fine-tuning and debugging of VideoFile threads is
	  horrible... This time, it looks like its working fine.
	* [r180] DISABLED refresh timer THREAD : this does not improves
	  anything, and adds yet another thread to synchronise. BUT, some
	  important BUG FIX in time management (e.g. start at begin, not 0), and
	  implementation of FRAME SKIPPING mechanism when the delay between
	  presentation time stamp and timer becomes too big.

2010-07-26  bruno.herbelin

	* [r179] BIG BUG FIX in video File management of TIME : changed QTimer
	  to QThread (mor precise delays?), long investigations in how to fix
	  problems of PTS and DTS (time stamps) when seeking, changed some
	  behavior and fixed some errors in Glmixer GUI events related to time
	  slader movements (pause / unpause mechanism).

2010-07-25  bruno.herbelin

	* [r178] Integration of DELAY CURSOR class. Nothing working for now...
	* [r177] BUG FIX for previous commit: single-frame VideoSources now use

	  the FFMPEG filtering.

2010-07-24  bruno.herbelin

	* [r176] FIXED implementation of filtering when VideoFile is PAUSED or

2010-07-18  bruno.herbelin

	* [r167] Implementation of CLEAR TO WHITE option for rendering manager
	  (after different trials with a generic clear color, I decided to allow
	  only BLACK or WHITE canvas for optimization reason).

2010-07-15  bruno.herbelin

	* [r166] Integration of the GUI for USER PREFERENCES (inneffective for
	  now).
	* [r165]
	* [r164] rename globalconfiguration into UserPreferenceDialog

	  Windows application (without stupid console). Implemented splash
	  screen for fun. Started to add elements for general configuration
	  dialog.
	* [r161] implementation of application SETTINGS + GLM session files view
	  configuration loading & saving. Fixed cosmetics for user dialogs.

2010-07-05  bruno.herbelin

	* [r148] Improved seek behavior when paused.

2010-07-04  bruno.herbelin

	* [r147] Bug FIX in media source filename (caused a crash on some file
	  names, e.g. on some other drives).
	* [r146] Implementation of ROTATION; this involved: adding TOOLs logic
	  (grab, scale, rotate), changing the way rendering window and fbo area
	  are projected (glOrtho), adapting the catalog view accordingly.

2010-06-17  bruno.herbelin@gmail.com

	* [r145] OSX compilation
	* [r144] OSX compilation

2010-06-17  bruno.herbelin

	* [r142] Catalog view icon clic + bug fix

2010-06-15  bruno.herbelin

	* [r141] Continuing implementation of catalog view (involving some
	  changes in rendering loops). Bug fix in file save/load dialogs. First
	  attempts for a rotation manipulator.

2010-06-03  bruno.herbelin

	* [r139] BUG fix ; some videos were not looping properly (now testing
	  queue to detect end of stream).

2010-06-02  bruno.herbelin

	* [r138] Fixed drag&drop of files (for XP).

2010-06-01  bruno.herbelin

	* [r137] Implemented DRAG & DROP of media files into the mixer and
	  loading of a configuration file as argument of the application.

2010-05-31  bruno.herbelin

	* [r136] Uniformization of clickedSource stack mechanism.

	  and optimization of view implementation accordingly. Context menu in
	  view & catalog.

2010-05-20  bruno.herbelin

	* [r134] Icons and textures for CATALOG view.
	* [r133] Beta implementation of CATALOG view. Several changes in
	  rendering to enable it + some cleanning.

2010-05-11  bruno.herbelin

	* [r132] Changed default cursors to custom (embeded) cursors for
	  uniformity and more choice (e.g. rotation icons). Also implemented TAB
	  and CTRL-TAB to switch current source.

2010-05-02  bruno.herbelin

	* [r131] Added icons for cursors and actions
	* [r130] Added icons for cursor and actions.

2010-04-30  bruno.herbelin@gmail.com

	* [r129] OSX compatibility

2010-04-30  bruno.herbelin

	* [r128] Linux compatibility

2010-04-30  bruno.herbelin@gmail.com

	* [r127] OSX compatibility

2010-04-19  bruno.herbelin

	* [r120] Improved Geometry SCALE (and bug fix). Starting geometry
	  ROTATION.

2010-04-18  bruno.herbelin

	* [r119] new source CREATION mechanism ; implementation of drop basket,
	  improvement of loading of xml file.

2010-04-11  bruno.herbelin

	* [r108] Important commit; implemented session SAVE and LOAD. This
	  required to change some interface to the source class and to some
	  child classes (opencv, media), to fix bugs in the reset of the views,
	  etc. On the way of uniformization of the source API, i implemented the
	  source 'color maps' to enhance the invert color single option.

2010-04-05  bruno.herbelin

	* [r107] Improved Output Render Widget and Window mechanism (both for
	  blitted and textured FBO). Code cosmetics; changed 'signals' 'slots'
	  into Qt macros 'Q_SIGNALS' and 'Q_SLOTS'.

2010-04-04  bruno.herbelin

	* [r106] Features improvements; display of mark in and out in property
	  tree (and computation of correct frame number in VideoFile class),
	  capture frame buffer and display in a dialog to save or create a
	  source.

2010-04-02  bruno.herbelin

	* [r104] Moved the FPS display code to ViewRenderWidget (no need to have
	  fps computation for every glWidget). Fixed a bug in capture source.
	* [r103] eye candy ; nicer shadow in mixing view.
	* [r102] Fixed BRIGHTNESS and CONTRAST generic implementation (and fixed
	  error in Capture source formerly commited).
	* [r101] Implementation of CAPTURE SOURCE class; this was necessary to
	  allow for the dynamic update of its content when applying filters. On
	  the way, little programming issues were fixed.
	* [r100] Fix incorect mask blending (now based on black masks). Some
	  minor bug fixes (prevent negative depth).

2010-03-31  bruno.herbelin

	* [r99] Implemented MASK with correct blending and property selection.
	  Improved property browser a bit, and added an auto warning FPS display
	  in case FPS drops dangerously.

2010-03-29  bruno.herbelin

	* [r98] Implemented blending MASKS and filtering. Small modifications of
	  source update mechanism to allow for an update request.

2010-03-24  bruno.herbelin@gmail.com

	* [r97] Tiny fixes for OSX compilation
	* [r96] Allow #ifndef OPENCV

2010-03-23  bruno.herbelin

	* [r95] Implementation of selection mechanisms for groups and multiple
	  selection with area.

2010-03-21  bruno.herbelin

	* [r94] implemented GROUPS of source in the mixing view.
	* [r93] Fixed and improved multiple selection of sources in MIXING view.
	* [r92] Added mechanism in Source Manager changeDepth method to prevent
	  sources from being at the same DEPTH. Fixed property browser.

2010-03-21  bruno.herbelin@gmail.com

	* [r91] minor visual improvements for OSX

2010-03-21  bruno.herbelin

	* [r89] Compilation configuration for OSX BUNDLE.

2010-03-20  bruno.herbelin

	* [r88] Forgot the cursor icons ...
	* [r87] Implemented the Property Manager (using libQtManager). Still
	  lots of cleaning to do... but it works.

2010-03-15  bruno.herbelin

	* [r86] Starting V0.7 ; starting implementation of PROPERTY BROWSER for
	  sources (using libQtProperty). The basic mechanism is there, now all
	  properties shall be implemented... BTW: improvement of textures for
	  the views.

2010-03-10  bruno.herbelin

	* [r85] Improvement of textures (GL code and image files).
	* [r84] Implemented CULLING mechanism ; the sources are not rendered to
	  FBO if they are outside the rendering area or if they are fully
	  transparent. (+ GUI updates)

2010-03-09  bruno.herbelin

	* [r79] BUG fix : crash on exit (loop error in RenderingManager clear
	  source set). Starting the Selection view.

2010-03-08  bruno.herbelin

	* [r75] Implemented PERLIN noise for Algorithm sources. also, I improved
	  the Algorithm selection dialog, and made few bug fixes (started to
	  code elements for version 0.7, but nothing used yet).

2010-03-07  bruno.herbelin

	* [r74] Keep preferences of Algorithm Selection Dialog.
	* [r73] Implemented "zoom best fit" for all views. Fixed the bug of the
	  disapearing dock widgets.

2010-03-06  bruno.herbelin

	* [r72] Modifications for OSX compilation (and improvements in Mixing
	  View)

2010-03-05  bruno.herbelin

	* [r70] Implemented PRE-FILTERING on VideoFile: brightness, contrast and
	  saturation. This required to change the copy operator of VideoPicture
	  and the VideoSource. On the way, I fixed a bug in the VideoFileDialog
	  and in the way it was used (a copy of the video file was left in the
	  background).

2010-03-03  bruno.herbelin

	* [r69] Made the depth view also show the blending; otherwise it does
	  not show the effect of changing depth.
	* [r68] Implementation of LAYERS view working; the Rendering manager
	  changeDepth fn and source copy operator have been changed to fix the
	  original stupid idea. On the way the VIEWs have been uniformed in
	  their design (to be continued though).

2010-03-02  bruno.herbelin

	* [r67] Implemented AlgorithmSelectionDialog using the
	  SourceDisplayWidget; I removed the OpencvDisplayWidget and now use
	  SourceDisplayWidget essentially in CameraDialog. On the may, the
	  cleaning of the list of source and ending of the program has been
	  cleaned (as well as some warnings in Qt4.5)

2010-03-01  bruno.herbelin

	* [r66] Many improvements and bug fixes. Most important changes; call of
	  destructor of Rendering Manager, opencv display widget for camera
	  dialog flickering fixed, clear FBO after last source removal.

2010-02-28  bruno.herbelin

	* [r65] Continue the development of AlgorithmSource (new dialog)
	* [r64] With source cloning, removing the original causes the clones to
	  be invalid ; there is now a mechanism keeping track of the list of
	  clones and recursively removing them when a source is removed.
	* [r57] Small but cool feature for the GEOMETRY view; the scaling is now
	  really working, also for horizontally or vertically flipping the
	  image! Minimal and maximal scales are also guaranteed.

2010-02-27  bruno.herbelin

	* [r56] Implemented CLONE source and started implementation of ALGORITHM
	  sources. Also cleanned the GUI and improved the layers view.
	* [r55] Continue development of layers view.
	* [r54] Continue development of layers view.
	* [r53] Continue development of layers view.

2010-02-26  bruno.herbelin

	* [r52] Implemented LAYERS VIEW (and the needed depth information in the
	  source and View classes). This pointed out a bug in the selection of
	  the (top most) current view ; therefore the introduction of the
	  reverseSourceSet which sorts the sources in opposite order.
	* [r51] Implemented blending options: this required to introduce GLEW
	  dependency under MSWindows (non-basic OpenGL functions), therefore the
	  several changes in common.h and qmake file.

2010-02-16  bruno.herbelin

	* [r50] OpenGL optimizations (from RED BOOK). Most important is the use
	  of glSubTexture2D to replace faster the content of a texture instead
	  of glTexture2D which creates a new one.
	* [r49] Bug fix in the zoom, changed SOURCE_UNIT to smaller value
	  (better for projection), and implemented zoom best fit for Mixing
	  View.

2010-02-15  bruno.herbelin

	* [r48] Cmake feature; read the SVN repository HEAD revision and use it
	  to show the revision number in the program.
	* [r47] Implemented GUI information for Capture and Rendering sources.

2010-02-14  bruno.herbelin

	* [r46] Made code compatible under Windows (GL_EXT_framebuffer_blit not
	  in glext.h) by using Qt v4.6. + cleaned include dependency on the way.
	* [r45] Implemented capture of rendering output (+ create source and
	  save to file). Added proper icons for source related actions and
	  modified the menu a bit.
	* [r44] Implemented loopback Rendering output as source. It works with
	  fbo and (if available) blitting of the fbo texture (to be fast).
	* [r43] Implemented mouse double click event

2010-02-13  bruno.herbelin

	* [r42] BIG OPENGL CLEANING: the manipulation view is not a
	  ViewRenderWidget which implements the view changing mechanism, the
	  OutputRenderWindow is now a OutputRenderWidget which implements the
	  FBO blit extension, + many OpenGL and QGLWidget optimizations.

2010-02-12  bruno.herbelin

	* [r41] Validated new version (+ minor bug fix)

2010-02-11  bruno.herbelin

	* [r40] BIG RE-DESIGN; in order to improve performances, the rendering
	  of every sources (loop over all video textures) is now done ONCE, and
	  the mixing rexult is rendered on the fly into an FBO. This FBO is then
	  displayed as a simple texture in the OutputRenderWindow (which is
	  extremely fast, even more with the FBO blit GL extension). To makes
	  things simpler, the RenderingManager is now dealing with the rendering
	  and the sources, and the views are only procedures used to know how to
	  show the manipulation view.

2010-02-08  bruno.herbelin

	* [r39] Bug fix in the management of selection std::map

2010-02-07  bruno.herbelin

	* [r38] Changed icons (previous had copyright) and added a ToolBar.
	* [r37] oops; finishing up last commit.
	* [r36] Bug fix (reset modelview by default for every GLRenderWidget to
	  avoid forgetting to do it !)
	* [r35] Implemented multiple files loading + icons and menu cosmetics.

2010-02-05  bruno.herbelin

	* [r29] Improved source depth management, added preview update period
	  change (to save perfs), bug fixes.

2010-02-04  bruno.herbelin

	* [r28] implemented panning in the Geometry view
	* [r27] Implemented better selection of source to modify in Geometry
	  view (with right mouse button to browse the list of sourses under the
	  cursor) + the necessary modifications in the other classes.

2010-02-03  bruno.herbelin

	* [r26] Implemented Geometry View. This required some heavy changes in
	  the management of the display lists; they are now centralized in the
	  MainRenderWidget (shared GL context) to be available in every view.

2010-02-01  bruno.herbelin

	* [r25] lighter icons
	* [r24] Added left bar to views (with zoom buttons)
	* [r23] Improved window manager integration (for XP)
	* [r22] Prevent from crash on exit (was over-deleting pointers
	  previously garbaged by Qt)
	* [r21] Improved CameraDialog GUI & bug fixed (added refresh detection
	  button)

2010-01-31  bruno.herbelin

	* [r20] finishing last partial commit
	* [r19] Added multiple view management and created empry geometry view
	  widget (+ some bug fixes).
	* [r18] Improved (and generalized) show/hide mechanism for GL rendering
	  widgets (start/kill update timer on show/hide events).
	* [r17] Added Source Preview class and docking widget, cleanning in
	  *DisplayWidget classes, bug fixes.

2010-01-30  bruno.herbelin

	* [r16] Re-design of glRenderWidget and MainRenderWidget to comply with
	  M$ XP bug with GLWidget sharing of GL context (MainRenderWidget has to
	  contain the render GLWidget)
	* [r15] forgotten #ifdef opencv
	* [r14] a common include file with ifdefs for platform dependent
	  features
	* [r13] Extended cmake detection for ffmpeg potential dependencies

2010-01-29  bruno.herbelin

	* [r12] Windows MinGW compilation compatibility patch

2010-01-27  bruno.herbelin

	* [r11] cosmetics and bug fixes in source selection
	* [r10] Mixing view: bug fixes OpenCV support; implemented multithreaded
	  update

2010-01-26  bruno.herbelin

	* [r9] Mixing view: management of currently selected source with GUI
	  synchronization
	* [r8] Started XML DOM support

2010-01-25  bruno.herbelin

	* [r7] First 'working' version with mixer view and opencv webcam drivers

2009-11-11  bruno.herbelin
